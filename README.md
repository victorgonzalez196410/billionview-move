# billionview-move

## Project Description

**billionview-move** is a Move smart contract suite designed for the Aptos blockchain, enabling a decentralized platform for content tracking, view counting, and creator monetization. It aims to provide transparent and immutable metrics for digital content engagement, supporting innovative business models based on verified viewership data.

## Features

- üìà Immutable view tracking recorded on-chain
- üîó Decentralized and transparent engagement metrics
- üîí Secure Move smart contract architecture
- üí∏ Monetization models for creators and content owners
- üõ†Ô∏è Extensible platform to integrate with web2 and web3 applications

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/victorgonzalez196410/billionview-move.git
cd billionview-move

# Install dependencies if needed (for frontend or scripts)
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Usage

### Deploy Smart Contracts

```bash
# Compile Move modules
aptos move compile --package-dir move/

# Deploy the contracts to the Aptos network
aptos move publish --package-dir move/ --profile default
```

### Local Testing

```bash
# Run Move unit tests
aptos move test --package-dir move/
```

### Interact with Contracts

- Record a view: Call the `record_view` entry function with the content ID.
- Query views: Use contract getters to retrieve total views for content.

You can interact via CLI commands, frontend integrations, or custom scripts using the Aptos SDK.

## Configuration

- Smart contract settings (e.g., creator addresses, fees, thresholds) can be modified in the Move modules before deployment.
- Network profiles (e.g., devnet, testnet, mainnet) can be configured in `aptos.yaml`.
